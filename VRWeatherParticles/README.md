VR Weather Particles
========

A relatively simple (yet still quite pretty) demo of glowing particles floating around your head. These particles move and change colour in response to the weather in various locations around the globe.

If you make something super wonderous and potentially more dizzying from this basic code, please do let me know! I'm on Twitter at @thatpatrickguy, or you can find me at http://www.patrickcatanzariti.com.

Hooray for tech funtimes!
